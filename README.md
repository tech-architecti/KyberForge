# GenAI Launchpad

With AI innovation moving beyond the speed of light, your time to develop is now more precious than ever. That’s why
we’ve built the GenAI Launchpad – your secret weapon to shipping production-ready AI apps, faster.

## 🚀 Introduction

Welcome to the GenAI Launchpad – your all-in-one repository for building powerful, scalable Generative AI applications.
Whether you’re prototyping or deploying at scale, this Docker-based setup has you covered with everything from
event-driven architecture to seamless AI workflow integration.

No need to start from scratch or waste time on repetitive configurations. The GenAI Launchpad is engineered to get you
up and running fast, with a flexible design that fits your workflow – all while keeping things production-ready from day
one.

> **Note**: This repository has two main branches:
> - [`main`](https://github.com/datalumina/genai-launchpad/tree/main): A stripped-down version with just the core
    components, perfect for starting new projects.
> - [`quickstart`](https://github.com/datalumina/genai-launchpad/tree/boilerplate): Contains a complete example
    implementation to demonstrate the Launchpad's capabilities
>
> We recommend following the Accelerator Course first to understand the example implementation in the `quickstart` branch.

## 🎯 Overview

The GenAI Launchpad isn’t just another framework – it’s your shortcut to a production-ready AI infrastructure. Built for
speed and control, its modular architecture brings together the best tools and design patterns to help you deploy faster
without compromising flexibility.

Here’s what you’re working with:

- FastAPI for lightning-fast API development
- Celery for background task processing
- PostgreSQL to handle all your data, includding embeddings
- Redis for fast task queue management
- Caddy for reverse proxy and automatic HTTPS

All services are containerized using Docker, ensuring consistency across development and deployment environments.
